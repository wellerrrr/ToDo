ToDO

This is pretty simple project. I made it to get more experience.

As you can see - there's no any difficult things. I added both frontend and backend - so that's explanes, that you can observe more functional on the backend side. Also there's a more things which touches Superuser side.

To run this project you need go to the project root, then activate the venv, after that you should go to 'blog' app, and then just run project - 'python manage.py runserver'
